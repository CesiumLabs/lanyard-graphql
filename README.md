# Lanyard GraphQL API

This is an port of [Lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard)'s REST API in GraphQL.

Lanyard is a RESTful API and websocket which is powered by a Discord bot, which exposes your Discord status to a REST API in less than 10 seconds. [Read the README](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard#readme) and [join their Discord server](https://discord.gg/WScAm7vNGF) for it to work.
